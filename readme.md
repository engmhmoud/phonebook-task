in this project we has accounts that represent our user



<!--  -->
we have contacts and this is our application that has all contacts data and views


Note: i didn't implemente multiple numbers for the same contact 
becouse i thouth it was only one phone and did't know that untile i finish the implementation and changing the to new requirements take all my time .

<!--  -->
abour erd this is simple
Table User : Represent user in system
Table Contacts : Represent Contacts for user 
has foreign key to user

Numbers : Represent all phone number for contacts so it has foreign key to contacts .
